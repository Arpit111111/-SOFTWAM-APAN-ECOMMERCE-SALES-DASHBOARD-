## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the APAN store understand their customers better. It helps the APAN store know if their customers are satisfied with their services. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. It also lets them know the average delay & departure time, thus since by using this dashboard they have identified this problem, they can further work on factors responsible for these unwanted delays.

Also since average delay in arrival & departure both is 15 minutes, thus they must try to reduce it.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check all the column and rows.
- Step 3 : As order ID is present in both the table is automatacally make relation between tables by using model view.
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values.
- Step 5 : Now we are start making dashbord In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 6 : Since the data contains various ratings, thus in order to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the Used
different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart,clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart,
area chart, map, slicers, etc) in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 7 : after that we add slicer on the bases of quater (three month each), take as tiles.
- Step 8 : and at least we add filter on the bases of states,
here we use drop down.

- Step 9 : Now we add four card sum of amount, sum of quentity, sum of profite, sum of AOV.
